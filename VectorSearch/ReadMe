4 steps happened when embedding model convert text value to embedding vector (float[]) 

########
Step 1: (Tokenizeation) Prepare inputs. Convert data into Ids, Masks and Token type ids

Step 2: (Transformer) Model transforms tokens → model use those inputs to generate embedding meaning vector

Step 3: You store the meaning vector into vector DB

Step 4: Search compares meaning vectors
